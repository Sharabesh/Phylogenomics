# Phylogenomic Protein Function Prediction
This project seeks to implement a full phylogenetic pipeline to serve as a tool for transmembrane helix prediction. A target sequence and neighboring homologs are annotated by TMHMM and RAxML's maximum likelihood constructor is used to determine contribution scores to each sequence.
